# Firebeetle zenoh-pico

The esp32 firebeetle is an older (now outdated even) esp32 board that supports wifi and bluetooth 4.2. The firebeetle brand has a focus on deepsleep power preservance but has no other relevance to this project. It supports arduino and espdif frameworks, doesn't support micropython and generally blends in pretty well with other esp32 boards. Here's a [link](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1590.html) if you want the specs

Do keep in mind code can often overlap or downright be the same for arduino boards, so you can reuse this code for other boards provided you change the board configuration and this code should for the most part work on any other esp32 with the arduino framework but it's good to be cautious of the small chance it doesn't work.
